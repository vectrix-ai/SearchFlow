 paginx is an innovative Python-based project that leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide intelligent question-answering capabilities for any given website. By simply entering a website URL, users can interact with an AI assistant that can answer questions and provide insights based on the content of the website.
