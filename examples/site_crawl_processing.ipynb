    "This Jupyter notebook contains a script that performs indexing and vectorization of web page contents. The primary purpose of this script is to crawl through a specified web page, extract the textual contents, and subsequently store these contents as vector objects in a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vectorized information can then be utilized in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) flow to answer questions using a Language Model (LLM). This process enables the creation of a more context-aware and responsive system, capable of providing detailed responses based on the indexed and vectorized information from the web page.\n",
