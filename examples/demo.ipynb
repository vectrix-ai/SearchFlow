    "\n",

    "   - Uses `vectrix.Crawler` to extract pages from \"https://vectrix.ai\"\n",
    "   - Limits the crawl to a maximum of 20 pages\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Content Chunking**:\n",
    "   - Utilizes `vectrix.Webchunker` to break down the extracted content\n",
    "   - Chunks are created with a size of 500 characters and an overlap of 50 characters\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Named Entity Recognition**:\n",
    "   - Employs `vectrix.Extract` with the 'Replicate' model\n",
    "   - Uses the 'meta/meta-llama-3-70b-instruct' model for entity extraction\n",

      "page_content='Image Extraction with Langchain and Gemini Ben Selleslagh In today's digital landscape, businesses are constantly seeking ways to optimize their online presence and streamline their operations. One powerful tool that's gaining traction is AI-powered image metadata extraction. At Vectrix, we've implemented this technology for a major online retailer, processing thousands of product images to enhance user experience and boost SEO rankings. What is Image Metadata Extraction? Image metadata extraction is the process of using artificial intelligence to analyze images and generate structured data about their content. This can include descriptions, colors, attributes, and even SEO-friendly hashtags. By leveraging advanced machine learning models, we can automatically extract valuable information from visual content, turning images into a rich source of data. The Business Benefits - Enhanced SEO: By generating rich, varied descriptions for images, you can significantly improve your search engine rankings. This increased visibility can drive more organic traffic to your site. - Improved User Experience: Detailed product descriptions help customers find exactly what they're looking for. This can lead to higher conversion rates and increased customer satisfaction. - Efficiency: Automate the tedious task of manually tagging and describing large image collections. This saves time and resources, allowing your team to focus on more strategic tasks. - Consistency: Ensure all your product images have uniformly high-quality descriptions. This consistency enhances your brand image and customer trust. - Data-Driven Insights: The extracted metadata can provide valuable insights into your product catalog, helping inform inventory decisions and marketing strategies. Our Approach: Leveraging Langchain and Gemini At Vectrix, we've developed a cutting-edge solution using Langchain and the multi-modal LLM Gemini-Flash-1.5. This powerful combination allows us to: - Process images at scale: Handle thousands of images quickly and efficiently. - Generate structured data outputs: Create consistent, formatted data that can be easily integrated into existing systems. - Ensure variety in descriptions for SEO purposes: Use advanced techniques to generate unique descriptions, boosting SEO effectiveness. Our approach combines the flexibility of Langchain's workflow management with the advanced image understanding capabilities of Gemini-Flash-1.5. This allows us to create customized solutions that meet the specific needs of each business. Real-World Application We applied this technology to a large online retailer's product catalog. The results were impressive: - Thousands of product images processed quickly and efficiently - Rich, varied descriptions generated for each product - Significant improvements in search visibility and user engagement - 30% increase in organic traffic to product pages - 15%' metadata={'source': 'https://vectrix.ai/blog-post/image-extraction-with-langchain-and-gemini', 'title': 'Image Metadata Extraction with Langchain & Gemini', 'description': 'Learn how to use Langchain and Gemini-Flash-1.5 for AI-powered image metadata extraction.
