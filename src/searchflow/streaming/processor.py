    A class for processing streaming events from a langgraph.

    This class initializes a LangSmith Client and provides methods to process
    streaming events from a graph, handling various event types and yielding
    progress updates, streamed data, and final outputs.

    Attributes:
        client (Client): An instance of the LangSmith Client.

    Methods:
        process_stream(graph, question): Asynchronously processes the stream of events
        from the given graph for the provided question.
